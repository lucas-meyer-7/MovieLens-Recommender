## Lucas Meyer

The repository is structured as follows:
 - ``report``: Contains the LaTeX code that was used to create the final report.
 - ``src``: Contains the Python source code for the recommender system.
   - ``movie_recommender.py``: The Python file that contains the *MovieRecommender* class.
   - ``movie_recommender.ipynb``: The notebook used to the test the *MovieRecommender* class.
 - ``Final Report.pdf``: This is the pdf file for my final report.
 
To understand how to use the MovieRecommender class, please refer to the notebook ``movie_recommender.ipynb``, since it acts as a tutorial.
